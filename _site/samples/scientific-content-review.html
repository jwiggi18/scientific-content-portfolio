<p><strong>Internal Review Memo (Anonymized Example)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Jodie Wiggins, Ph.D.<br />
<strong>Role Context:</strong> Scientific Director / Scientific Content Lead<br />
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Demonstrate scientific review, risk assessment, and strategic guidance for scientific and medical communications</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>This memo illustrates my approach to reviewing and guiding scientific content at a leadership level. The example below reflects a <strong>representative internal scientific review</strong>, conducted to assess accuracy, interpretive risk, clarity, and alignment with audience and strategic objectives.</p>

<p>The focus of this review is <strong>scientific oversight rather than line editing</strong>, with emphasis on judgment, risk-aware framing, and support for high-quality, fit-for-purpose communication.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="reviewed-content-anonymized">Reviewed Content (Anonymized)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Format:</strong> 12-slide educational slide deck</li>
  <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Healthcare professionals and scientific stakeholders</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong><br />
To summarize current scientific understanding of a disease area, including biological mechanisms, emerging research findings, and areas of active investigation</li>
  <li><strong>Source Material:</strong><br />
Peer-reviewed literature, mechanistic studies, and clinical research</li>
  <li><strong>Development Context:</strong><br />
Content developed by a multidisciplinary team for educational use</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="summary-assessment">Summary Assessment</h2>

<p>Overall, the content demonstrates a high level of scientific rigor, thoughtful evidence selection, and clear educational intent, reflecting strong foundational work by the team. With small, targeted refinements, the material can further reduce interpretive risk, enhance clarity for the intended audience, and strengthen alignment between the evidence presented and the resulting conclusions. These adjustments build on an already solid framework and will help ensure the content is as clear, credible, and impactful as possible.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="strengths-identified">Strengths Identified</h2>

<h3 id="scientific-accuracy-and-evidence-base">Scientific Accuracy and Evidence Base</h3>
<p>The content demonstrates strong scientific rigor and careful use of evidence throughout. Key mechanistic claims are supported by appropriate primary literature, and citations are used consistently to anchor interpretations in data rather than speculation.</p>

<p><strong>Representative strengths include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear and accurate depiction of the biological pathway of interest, with mechanistic steps aligned with current peer-reviewed understanding.</li>
  <li>Effective integration of findings from multiple study types (e.g., mechanistic studies and clinical research) to provide a balanced scientific picture rather than relying on a single line of evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>These choices establish a solid and credible scientific foundation for the material.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="logical-organization-and-narrative-flow">Logical Organization and Narrative Flow</h3>
<p>The content is well structured, with a logical progression from foundational concepts to more detailed scientific discussion. This sequencing supports comprehension and allows readers to build understanding as the narrative advances.</p>

<p><strong>Representative strengths include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Early introduction of core biological concepts and terminology, which are then consistently referenced and built upon in later sections.</li>
  <li>Use of intermediate summary slides or transitions that reinforce key takeaways before introducing additional complexity.</li>
</ul>

<p>This organization supports clarity and reduces cognitive load for the audience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="appropriate-educational-tone">Appropriate Educational Tone</h3>
<p>The material maintains a clear educational focus and avoids promotional framing. Language choices consistently signal that the science is being presented to inform understanding rather than to direct conclusions or actions.</p>

<p><strong>Representative strengths include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Careful framing of emerging data as part of an evolving evidence base, rather than presenting preliminary findings as definitive.</li>
  <li>Explicit use of neutral, explanatory language when discussing mechanisms and research outcomes, reinforcing the educational intent of the content.</li>
</ul>

<p>This tone supports responsible interpretation and aligns well with expectations for scientific and medical education materials.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="strategic-recommendations">Strategic Recommendations</h2>

<p>The following recommendations are intended to <strong>build on the content’s existing strengths</strong> by enhancing clarity, appropriately calibrating interpretation, and reinforcing alignment between evidence and conclusions. These are <strong>small, targeted refinements</strong> that support scientific rigor while improving usability and confidence for the intended audience.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-calibrate-interpretive-language-to-match-evidence-strength">1. Calibrate Interpretive Language to Match Evidence Strength</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why this matters</strong><br />
Precise calibration of interpretive language helps maintain scientific credibility and supports responsible audience understanding, particularly when presenting emerging or evolving data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several statements would benefit from minor wording adjustments to more explicitly reflect the current strength of evidence. This does not change the scientific message, but ensures that interpretations are consistently aligned with what the data can support.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Use language that distinguishes association from causation where appropriate</li>
  <li>Clearly signal when findings are hypothesis-generating or under active investigation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example language strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>“Current evidence suggests…”</li>
  <li>“Has been associated with…”</li>
  <li>“Is an area of ongoing research…”</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-surface-key-limitations-and-uncertainty-at-decision-points">2. Surface Key Limitations and Uncertainty at Decision Points</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why this matters</strong><br />
Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty reinforces trust and prevents overextension of conclusions, especially in educational scientific content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While limitations are present in the underlying literature, they are not always surfaced at the points where conclusions are drawn. Briefly highlighting these considerations strengthens credibility without adding unnecessary complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Incorporate concise statements addressing study design, population scope, or variability in findings</li>
  <li>Reinforce where evidence is converging versus where it remains incomplete</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
Improved transparency and a clearer signal to the audience about how confidently findings should be interpreted.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="3-strengthen-narrative-signposting-and-message-hierarchy">3. Strengthen Narrative Signposting and Message Hierarchy</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why this matters</strong><br />
Clear signposting helps audiences orient themselves within complex scientific material and retain key takeaways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The overall structure is strong; however, elevating key messages earlier and reinforcing them throughout the narrative will further enhance clarity and impact.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce high-level scientific takeaways early in the content</li>
  <li>Use brief transition statements to connect detailed sections back to overarching objectives</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
A more cohesive narrative that reinforces strategic intent while preserving scientific depth.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="4-support-accessibility-through-layered-detail">4. Support Accessibility Through Layered Detail</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why this matters</strong><br />
Layered presentation allows diverse audiences to engage with content at an appropriate depth without diluting rigor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some highly technical sections could benefit from brief contextual framing to support readers with varying levels of background knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add short framing statements or summaries before dense technical sections</li>
  <li>Maintain detailed explanations for readers seeking deeper engagement</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br />
Improved usability across the intended audience while maintaining scientific precision.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>These recommendations are designed to <strong>enhance an already strong piece of scientific content</strong>. By making small, targeted refinements to language, structure, and framing, the material can further strengthen its clarity, credibility, and educational impact while remaining firmly grounded in the underlying science.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This review reflects my approach to scientific content leadership: balancing accuracy, clarity, and strategic intent while proactively identifying risks related to overinterpretation, ambiguity, or audience mismatch. My goal in this role is to elevate content through thoughtful guidance, support contributors in producing their strongest work, and ensure that scientific communications are credible, responsible, and fit for purpose.</p>
