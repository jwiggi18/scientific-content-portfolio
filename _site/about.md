I’m Jodie Wiggins, Ph.D. (Evolutionary Biology). I specialize in translating complex life sciences and clinical genomics into clear, audience-appropriate content.

My work includes clinician-facing briefs, patient/advocate education, and content systems that support accuracy, consistency, and scalability.

**Core strengths:** scientific writing, analytical and creative thinking, content strategy, SME collaboration, and evidence-aware communication.
