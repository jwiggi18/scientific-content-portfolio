## Overview

Clinical exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are used both to diagnose known rare genetic diseases and to evaluate patients whose conditions remain undiagnosed after standard testing. When appropriately applied and interpreted, these technologies can provide actionable insights that inform diagnosis, guide clinical management, and support patient care. However, effective use requires a clear understanding of what these tests can—and cannot—reliably determine.

This brief outlines the core capabilities, interpretive considerations, and limitations of clinical exome and genome sequencing to support informed clinical decision-making.

## What Exome and Genome Sequencing Are

Exome sequencing focuses on the protein-coding regions of the genome, where a substantial proportion of currently recognized disease-causing variants have been identified.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) captures both coding and non-coding regions, enabling evaluation of regulatory and other non-coding variation that may contribute to disease in select cases.

Selection of testing modality should be guided by clinical context, prior testing history, and diagnostic goals.

## What Exome and Genome Sequencing Can Identify

Exome and genome sequencing can reliably detect certain classes of genetic variants, with detection scope determined by the testing modality. Exome sequencing identifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) within protein-coding regions, while genome sequencing enables detection of these variants across both coding and non-coding regions of the genome.

When combined with robust variant annotation, curated reference databases, and phenotype-driven analysis, sequencing results may support the identification of variants associated with genetic disease in patients with suspected inherited conditions.

## Interpreting Variant Classifications

Clinical laboratories classify variants using established frameworks that consider multiple lines of evidence, including population frequency data, functional studies, segregation analysis, and prior clinical observations.

Common classifications include:
- Pathogenic  
- Likely pathogenic  
- Variant of uncertain significance (VUS)  
- Likely benign  
- Benign  

Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants may be considered consistent with a genetic diagnosis when they align with the patient’s clinical presentation. Variants classified as benign or likely benign are not expected to contribute to disease. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) reflect insufficient evidence to determine whether a variant is pathogenic or benign and should not be used as the sole basis for clinical decision-making.

It is important to recognize that variant classification reflects the **current state of scientific evidence** and may change as new data emerge. Clinical interpretation should integrate sequencing results with patient phenotype, family history, and additional diagnostic information.

## The Role of Phenotype-Driven Analysis

Accurate and detailed phenotypic information substantially improves variant interpretation. Phenotype-driven analysis enables prioritization of variants that are most consistent with observed clinical features, reducing ambiguity and supporting more confident conclusions.

Incomplete or nonspecific phenotype data can limit interpretive power and increase the likelihood of uncertain results.

## Key Limitations and Considerations

While powerful, exome and genome sequencing have important limitations:

- Not all disease-causing variants are detectable with current sequencing technologies  
- Structural variants, repeat expansions, and certain mosaic variants may be missed or incompletely characterized  
- A negative result does not exclude a genetic etiology  
- Variants of uncertain significance should not be used as the sole basis for clinical decision-making  

Understanding these limitations is essential for setting appropriate expectations and avoiding over-interpretation.

## Responsible Clinical Use

Clinical genomic testing is most effective when used as part of a comprehensive diagnostic strategy that includes clinical evaluation, family history, and ongoing re-assessment as scientific knowledge evolves. Clear communication with patients and families regarding uncertainty, limitations, and the potential need for reinterpretation over time is critical.

Exome sequencing is often appropriate as a first-line test for suspected single-gene conditions, while genome sequencing may be considered when prior testing is negative or when broader variant detection is clinically warranted.

## Conclusion

Exome and genome sequencing offer transformative opportunities in the diagnosis of genetic disease, but their clinical value depends on careful interpretation, appropriate contextualization, and responsible use. By understanding both the capabilities and limitations of these technologies, healthcare providers can maximize their benefit while maintaining scientific rigor and patient trust.
