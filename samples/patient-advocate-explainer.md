# Understanding Exome and Genome Sequencing  
## What These Tests Can (and Can’t) Tell You

**Audience:** Patients, families, and advocates  
**Purpose:** To explain exome and genome sequencing in clear, accessible language  
**Context:** Scientific communication sample translating clinical genomics concepts for non-specialist audiences

## What Are Exome and Genome Sequencing?

Exome and genome sequencing are genetic tests used that evaluate a person’s DNA in order to identify possible genetic causes of health conditions.

Your DNA contains instructions that tell your body how to grow and function. Much of what the body does is carried out by proteins, which perform essential tasks in cells and tissues. Some parts of DNA provide the instructions for making proteins, while other parts help regulate how cells function. Changes in these DNA instructions—called *variants*—can sometimes be associated with disease.

Exome sequencing focuses on the parts of DNA that directly code for proteins. Genome sequencing examines both these protein-coding regions and the rest of the DNA, including regions involved in regulating how cells function.

Both tests are used to help doctors better understand conditions that may have a genetic cause, especially when symptoms are unexplained or previous testing has not provided clear answers.

---

## Why Might These Tests Be Recommended?

Exome and genome sequencing are often used when:

- A person has symptoms that suggest a genetic condition  
- A diagnosis is unclear despite prior medical testing  
- There is concern about a condition with a possible inherited component    
- Understanding whether genetics may play a role could guide care or future planning 

These tests can sometimes identify a genetic explanation for symptoms and help doctors confirm or refine a diagnosis.

---

## What Can These Tests Identify?

Exome and genome sequencing can detect certain types of changes in DNA, including small changes that affect individual genes.

Depending on the type of test used:

- **Exome sequencing** looks for changes in genes that directly code for proteins  
- **Genome sequencing** looks for similar changes across the entire DNA sequence, including regions outside genes  

When combined with detailed medical information and family history, these results may help identify genetic changes that are relevant to a person’s health.

## Understanding Genetic Test Results

Genetic test results are typically placed into categories based on the available scientific evidence.

Some results may:

- Support a genetic explanation for a person’s condition  
- Indicate a change in DNA that is not expected to affect health  
- Identify a change where there is not enough information yet to know whether it is related to disease  

A result called a **Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)** means that scientists do not currently have enough evidence to determine whether a specific DNA change is related to a health condition. These findings are common and do **not** confirm or rule out a diagnosis on their own.

Importantly, genetic test results may be updated over time as new research becomes available.

---

## Why Results Don’t Always Provide Clear Answers

Even with advanced testing, genetic results do not always explain a person’s symptoms.

This can happen because:

- Not all genetic causes of disease are currently known  
- Some types of genetic changes are difficult to detect  
- A condition may not be genetic in origin  
- The genetic contribution may be complex or involve multiple factors  

A negative or uncertain result does **not** mean that symptoms are not real or important.

## Using Genetic Testing Responsibly

Genetic testing is most helpful when used as part of a broader medical evaluation. Doctors consider genetic results alongside medical history, physical findings, family history, and other tests.

Clear communication between healthcare providers, patients, and families is essential—especially when results are uncertain or may change over time.

Genetic testing is a powerful tool, but it is only one piece of the diagnostic process.

## Key Takeaways

- Exome and genome sequencing can help identify genetic causes of health conditions, but they do not always provide definitive answers  
- Results may change as science advances  
- Uncertain results are common and should be interpreted carefully  
- Genetic testing is most informative when interpreted in the context of a person’s overall medical care

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Will exome or genome sequencing always provide a diagnosis?

No. While these tests can sometimes identify genetic factors related to a person’s symptoms, they do not always lead to a clear diagnosis. Some conditions may not have a known genetic cause, and in other cases, current science may not yet be able to fully explain the findings.

---

### What does it mean if my results are uncertain?

An uncertain result, often called a **Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS)**, means that there is not enough scientific evidence at this time to determine whether a specific genetic change is related to a health condition. These results are common and should not be used on their own to make medical decisions.

---

### Can genetic test results change over time?

Yes. As scientific knowledge advances and more data become available, genetic test results may be updated or reinterpreted. A result that is uncertain today may be better understood in the future.

---

### Does a negative result mean there is no genetic explanation?

Not necessarily. A negative result means that the test did not identify a genetic finding that clearly explains the condition at this time. It does not rule out a genetic contribution, and it does not mean that symptoms are not real or important.

---

### Why might genome sequencing be recommended instead of exome sequencing?

Genome sequencing examines a broader portion of DNA than exome sequencing. It may be considered when prior testing has not provided clear answers or when a broader evaluation of genetic variation is clinically appropriate. The choice of test depends on individual circumstances and clinical judgment.

---

### Who can help me understand my results?

Healthcare providers and genetic counselors are trained to explain genetic test results and discuss what they may mean for you and your family. They can also help address questions, uncertainty, and next steps.

## What to Ask Your Healthcare Provider

If you are considering exome or genome sequencing, or if you have already received results, the following questions may help guide conversations with your healthcare provider or genetic counselor:

- What is the goal of this test for my specific situation?
- Why is exome or genome sequencing being recommended instead of other tests?
- What types of results are most likely, and what would they mean for my care?
- What are the possible limitations of this test?
- How should uncertain results be interpreted?
- Could my results change over time as new information becomes available?
- How might these results affect my medical care, screening, or future planning?
- Are there implications for my family members?
- What follow-up or additional testing, if any, might be recommended?
- Who should I contact if I have questions about my results in the future?

These discussions can help ensure that genetic testing is used thoughtfully and that results are understood within the context of your overall medical care.
